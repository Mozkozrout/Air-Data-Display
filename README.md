To run the app:
1. Download it
2. Run "composer install" command
3. configure your Databse connection in .env file
4. Run "php artisan migrate" command
5. To start the server run "php artisan serve" or use your own server
6. ???
7. Profit

It's an app that lets the user view Air measurement data loaded from an external API.

I wasn't sure whether this app is supposed to have any login functionality so i added it to be sure since the Assignment doc mentioned something about admin access. I also wasn't sure whether those data are real or anything so i didn't want to risk exposing them. I am not sure if basic laravel html templates with Bootstrap count as slick design but that is what i did. Also initially i made the app to simply load the data from the API with each refresh but since i already had the database there i decided to make a table for the data too and load them in there. I made this run on the schedule too but my hosting doesn't support cronjobs sadly, the code is there tho. I did this cause if this was a real app i wouldn't want my users to spam the API with all those concurrent requests each time they view the page. To make this even better i could probably implement a cache and a limiter.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
